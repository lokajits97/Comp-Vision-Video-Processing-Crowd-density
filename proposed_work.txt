3) PROPOSED FRAMEWORK =>

    Our proposed framework is composed of four processing blocks :
    1) Computation of Optical Flow
    2) Intensity Calculations using velocities computed from optical flow
    3) Conversion into Binary Image using velocity threshold
    4) Creation of contours satisfying a predefined range of estimnated area of
    each contour


    In this section, we will discuss each processing
    block in detail. For sake of description of the proposed
    approach we will employ videos taken from a crowd
    related data set.
    
    3.1) Computation of Optical Flow ::
         Computation of Optical Flow is the most important preprocessing
         step for detecting` the moving objects from the video and therefore forms
         the basis of our framework.
         Optical Flow Computation is useful for detection, tracking and
         understanding the behavior of the object. Traditionally, in video
         surveillance with a fixed camera, researchers use background subtraction
         method, where foreground objects are extracted from video if the pixels
         in the current frame deviate significantly from the background.
         Usually crowded objects move in wide areas, and for crowd flow
         segmentation, we need to detect change in every pixel, so optical flow
         methods reported in literature to compute sparse optical flow using the
         interest points (Lucas-Kanade optical flow) [LK+81] or dense optical
         flow for all pixels (HS optical flow) [HS81] in each frame can be used.
         Since, we want to detect change in every pixel, we compute
         dense optical flow. Since the optical flow vector of
         each pixel has the magnitude and direction values, we use magnitude information to extract foreground, 
         all the pixels which have higher magnitude than Tth
         will be classified as foreground
